# Thincking Machines

::: intro

Thinking Machines is a semester project in which students will revisit the concept of “personal computers” in the age of neural networks and explore how the creation of personalised assistants can reshape their creative workflow.

Throughout the semester, the project will revisit a number of important concepts and innovations from the history of computer science as a reminder that the idea of a “thinking” machine is as old as computing itself.

## context

While industrial automation finishes the final touches of replacing physical labor with computer-controlled machines, it is now the turn of the “white-collar” jobs to be replaced by software robots. Writers (journalists, copy editors, translators), mid-level managers, commercial vendors, medical analysts (disease identification, pathology detection, DNA analysis) — all of these fields, along with many others, are in the process of being automated by machines. Design is an obvious ‘next target’ of this automation process.


## strategy

This proposal clearly outlines a stark, even dystopian view of the future of visual communication. Our stated goals approach this future with a certain sense of irony. But we also wish to return to a number of early principles that gave birth to the computer sciences, personal computers, open source communities, and a world wide web of collective collaboration — and ask what new design strategies could re-engage us with the humanist principles at work from the beginnings of design but also from the beginnings of computer science.


## goals

The students will work as a collective, creating a Fictional Design StudioTM in which the classic workflow has been radically transformed by neural networks and automated machines. The final output will be a publication in the form of a book. The content of this publication will be decided/generated collectively during the course of the semester.


## presentation

The process will be documented and presented as a performative installation that can be exhibited/activated first at the HEAD Open Days, and then in various festivals. Students are transformed into “operators” of the system that they themselves designed. A video documentation will be produced by a Media Design alumni of the overall process and the project in its final form. A scenography will be built in collaboration with a Space & Communication alumni of the Fictional Design Studio<sup>TM</sup>.


## method

The project leads, in collaboration with the students, will begin by formalising the various internal and external roles of a design studio — identifying both core and bespoke tools, techniques, competencies and interests from each collaborator of the studio. These competencies might range from copy editing, typography, image treatment and page layout, to accounting and handling input from collaborators, clients, and competing studios.

An automated workflow will then be prototyped, designed, and developed using contemporary tools designed principally for the web (javascript, markdown, web standards, etc).


## result (translation!)

The Loom est un projet qui revisite la chaîne graphique en incluant dans le processus de création des ordinateurs personnels. Fonctionnant sur la base du machine learning et des technologies web, il est une référence aux premières apparitions de techniques de programmation et inspiré par l’iconographie du métier à tisser.  
En effet, partant d’une carte perforée à remplir, nous avons repris ce principe pour initier notre chaîne de création et l’interaction avec la machine. L’utilisateur va se rendre de station en station pour créer son propre conte, en passant de la génération du texte, à la mise en page et la création d’illustration pour finir à l’impression d’un petit livret. Pour terminer, il sera donné à l’utilisateur le choix de repartir avec son conte ou de le laisser pour compléter le grand recueil.
