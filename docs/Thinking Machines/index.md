# Thinking Machines

::: intro

Thinking Machines radically transforms designers' workflow by revisiting the concept of “personal computers” in the age of neural networks.

While industrial automation finishes the final touches of replacing physical labor with computer-controlled machines, it is now the turn of the “white-collar” jobs to be replaced by software robots. Writers , mid-level managers, commercial vendors, medical analysts  — all of these fields, along with many others, are in the process of being automated by machines. 

Design is an obvious ‘next target’ of this automation process.
 
This collective project realized by first year students from Master Media at HEAD – Genève asks what new design strategies could re-engage us with the humanist principles at work from the beginnings of computer science.
 
 ## A Loom to generate stories  
 
The Loom is an an automated publishing  workflow that operates on machine learning, hand shadows, text generator, tools for the web and voice recognition.  

It starts with a perforated card to fill and some (not so random) questions to answer. You are then guided from one station to the next to create your own story. Each station unlocks a new interaction from generating a text with an AI, drawing your layout with a pen or creating your visuals with hand shadow. The result is a unique small booklet co-created by you and a series of digital assistants.

With a certain sense of irony, The Loom outlines a stark, even dystopian view of the future of visual communication. But deep downs, The Loom wishes to return to a number of early principles that gave birth to the computer sciences, personal computers, open source communities, and a world wide web of collective collaboration.
