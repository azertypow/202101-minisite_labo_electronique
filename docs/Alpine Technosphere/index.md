# Alpine Technosphere

::: intro

How do we live with technologies in the mountains? How do technologies influence our relationship with the alpine environment? What does this presence of human infrastructure mean in the context of the environmental crisis?

:::

The elements shown on this website reflects the material we collected and produced during a workshop that combined field research methods and 3D design. This workshop, completed in January 2020, aimed at documenting the place of technologies and their integration in the Alpine landscape, taking the case of the Chamonix Valley as an example. This theme was based on current debates about the environmental crisis and its many facets (climate change, pollution, biodiversity breakdown). We chose to address this topic through a poetic observation of the [Technosphere](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/Peter-K-Haff-9xPhMR94HxWA8LJ6GHmTPm), i.e. the set of infrastructure that humans have built for their activities (habitats, factories, farms, transport systems, computers, tourism, etc.) Rather than denouncing the presence of technical objects in an environment often thought of as “natural” and pristine, the posture we adopted consisted in grasping the use of technologies in this context in order to explore our relationship with the alpine environment. 

We spent several days in the Chamonix Valley, documenting the presence of different kinds of technologies (ski lift, roads, mountain vehicles such as snow plows and bobcats, former mines and quarries). Using field research methods such as photography, photo scanning techniques, video, sound recording, electromagnetic waves detection as well as drawings, we collected material that we turned into 3D pieces to express our observations. Some were interested in artificial snow machines, others in former mines, or glacial boulders turned into gravestones as well as the general atmosphere of the Valley.

At the crossroads of design and ethnography, this workshop aimed to teach the importance of observation in the context of the environmental crisis. While designers are often asked to find “solutions”, we chose to take a step back and adopt a different approach. Our field trip aimed to understand local parameters and constraints of the man-made technosphere, in order to highlight the various ranges of technological issues at stake in a mountain context. We hope that such projects can add nuances about the future ways of living in the Alps.
